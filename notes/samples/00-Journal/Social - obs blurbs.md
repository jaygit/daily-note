Short social blurbs for announcing and sharing the `obs` CLI helpers.

X / Twitter (short)
- Built `obs` — a tiny CLI companion for Obsidian vaults. Create notes from the shell, fuzzy-search with previews, and install via an XDG-aware shim. Open, portable, and test-friendly. Repo: <repo-url> #obs #obsidian #cli #productivity

Mastodon (longer)
- I built `obs`: a set of small, composable shell scripts to create and manage notes in an Obsidian vault from the terminal. It ships an XDG-friendly installer, persistent `scripts/.env`, fallbacks for minimal CI containers, and tests that run headless. Great for quick capture and automation. <repo-url>

LinkedIn / Blog excerpt
- Announcing `obs` — a CLI-first helper for Obsidian vaults focused on making note capture and vault workflows scriptable and discoverable from the shell. Key features to highlight:
	- CLI ergonomics: `obs -o <operation>` for operations, `obs -v|--version` to show the installed version, `obs -e|--env` to print the runtime environment, and `obs --uninstall` to cleanly remove an install.
	- Installer & manpage: XDG-aware installer that persists runtime settings to `scripts/.env`, and an included manpage (`man/obs.1`) so users can read `man obs` after installation.
	- Portable design: small composable scripts, robust fallbacks for minimal environments, and deterministic test stubs for CI.

Reddit / Hacker News (discussion starter)
- I wrote `obs`, a shell-first toolkit for working with Obsidian vaults. It focuses on small scripts, testability (CI stubs), and an XDG-aware installer. Curious: how do you capture notes from the terminal? What workflows would you automate with a CLI note tool?
