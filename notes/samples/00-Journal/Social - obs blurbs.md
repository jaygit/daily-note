Short social blurbs for announcing and sharing the `obs` CLI helpers.

X / Twitter (short)
- Built `obs` — a tiny CLI companion for Obsidian vaults. Create notes from the shell, fuzzy-search with previews, and install via an XDG-aware shim. Open, portable, and test-friendly. Repo: <repo-url> #obs #obsidian #cli #productivity

Mastodon (longer)
- I built `obs`: a set of small, composable shell scripts to create and manage notes in an Obsidian vault from the terminal. It ships an XDG-friendly installer, persistent `scripts/.env`, fallbacks for minimal CI containers, and tests that run headless. Great for quick capture and automation. <repo-url>

LinkedIn / Blog excerpt
- Announcing `obs` — a CLI-first toolset for Obsidian-style vaults. Designed for reproducible note capture, scriptable workflows, and platform-agnostic installs. Includes: `create_note.sh`, `search.sh` with `rg`/`fzf` previews, `gitnotes.sh` for vault-scoped git, and a simple installer that persists `VERSION` and `VAULT_DIR` in `scripts/.env`.

Reddit / Hacker News (discussion starter)
- I wrote `obs`, a shell-first toolkit for working with Obsidian vaults. It focuses on small scripts, testability (CI stubs), and an XDG-aware installer. Curious: how do you capture notes from the terminal? What workflows would you automate with a CLI note tool?
